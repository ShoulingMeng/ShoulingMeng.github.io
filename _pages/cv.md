**Gaobo Zhao** received his bachelor’s and master’s degree in 2017 and 2020 from Henan Polytechnic University. In 2019, Mr. Zhao attended WVU as a visiting scholar from January to May. In August 2021, he joined WVU as a graduate research assistant and started his Ph.D. Before WVU, Mr. Zhao focused on overburden failure and surface subsidence due to longwall mining using physical/numerical simulation and mechanics/mathematics theory analysis. He participated in various research projects, such as establishing observation stations for monitoring surface movement and deformation, measuring fractured zone height by observing underground borehole water leakage, creating and running numerical models of mines in 3DEC for analyzing the stresses and displacements. He finished three chapters in two books, and produced 34 publications (6 journal papers in English, 25 journal papers in Chinese, 3 conference papers) and made two presentations in Xi'an City, China and Salt Lake City, UT, respectively. He received various awards and scholarships including but not limited to the Henan Province Outstanding Graduates Award, China Undergraduate National Encouragement Scholarship, and China Postgraduate National Scholarship. His current research focuses on roof support systems under Dr. Ishan Berk Tulu.
